# CareSight Feature Testing Report

## Test Plan for New Features

### 1. Enhanced AI Chat Testing

#### Test Cases:
- ✅ Medical terminology questions (e.g., "What is hypertension?")
- ✅ Medical condition explanations (e.g., "What does positive nodes mean?")
- ✅ Safety boundaries (personal medical advice)
- ✅ Referral to healthcare providers

#### Test Results:
- API endpoint working at `/api/chat`
- Medical knowledge base integrated
- Safe response guidelines implemented

### 2. PersonalizedWelcome Component Testing

#### Features to Test:
- ✅ User preference loading from localStorage
- ✅ Text-to-speech welcome messages
- ✅ Personalized health focus areas display
- ✅ Guided tour functionality
- ✅ Settings integration

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **New User with Blood Pressure Condition**:
   - Should display blood pressure monitoring card
   - TTS should mention blood pressure in welcome message
   - Tour should include BP-specific steps

2. **User with Multiple Conditions**:
   - Should display multiple health focus cards
   - Welcome message should list all conditions
   - Tour should be comprehensive

3. **Accessibility User**:
   - TTS should work on first visit
   - Voice should be clear and caring
   - Tour should include accessibility features

### 3. BackgroundAnimations Testing

#### Dark Mode Animation:
- ✅ 50 twinkling stars
- ✅ Occasional shooting stars
- ✅ Calm, non-distracting movement
- ✅ Proper z-index layering

#### Light Mode Animation:
- ✅ 8 floating lava lamp blobs
- ✅ Gentle particle effects
- ✅ Smooth color transitions
- ✅ Performance optimization

### 4. Data Storage and Retrieval Testing

#### UserPreferences Object:
```json
{
  "textToSpeech": boolean,
  "age": string,
  "medicalConditions": string[],
  "emergencyContacts": array,
  "caregiverEmails": string[],
  "accessibilityNeeds": string[],
  "hasBloodPressure": boolean,
  "hasDiabetes": boolean,
  "hasHeartCondition": boolean,
  "hasAsthma": boolean
}
```

#### Test Results:
- ✅ Onboarding saves preferences correctly
- ✅ Dashboard loads preferences on page load
- ✅ Boolean flags work for condition checking
- ✅ Accessibility preferences preserved

## Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Complete Onboarding
1. Go to `/onboarding`
2. Select health conditions (e.g., Blood Pressure, Diabetes)
3. Enable text-to-speech
4. Complete onboarding
5. Verify preferences saved in localStorage

### Step 2: Test Dashboard Personalization
1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Verify PersonalizedWelcome shows selected conditions
3. Check if TTS welcome message plays (first visit)
4. Confirm background animations are active
5. Test guided tour functionality

### Step 3: Test AI Chat
1. Go to `/chat`
2. Ask: "What is hypertension?"
3. Ask: "What does positive nodes mean?"
4. Ask: "Should I take medication X?" (should decline personal advice)
5. Verify appropriate responses

### Step 4: Test Theme Integration
1. Toggle between light and dark mode
2. Verify background animations change appropriately
3. Check PersonalizedWelcome styling in both themes
4. Ensure all components are properly themed

## Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor:
- Background animation FPS
- Component rendering time
- Memory usage with animations
- TTS initialization time
- localStorage read/write performance

### Optimization Notes:
- Animations use requestAnimationFrame
- Components are memoized where appropriate
- TTS checks for browser support
- LocalStorage operations are minimal

## Accessibility Testing

### Features to Verify:
- Text-to-speech functionality
- Keyboard navigation through guided tour
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Voice selection for TTS

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Get feedback from users with different conditions
2. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor animation performance on lower-end devices
3. **Feature Enhancement**: Add more medical conditions and personalization
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify compatibility with existing features
5. **Mobile Testing**: Ensure responsive design works on all devices
