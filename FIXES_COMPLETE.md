## ✅ Issue #3: Rough Personalization Features - SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED
**Problem**: Personalization features were rough and not user-friendly
**Root Cause**: Basic implementation without interactive elements
**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced `generateWelcomeMessage()` with time-of-day greetings and condition-specific advice

## ✅ Issue #4: Non-functional Demo/Tour System - FULLY OPERATIONAL
**Problem**: Demo system was non-functional with "coming soon" placeholders
**Root Cause**: Incomplete implementation with static content
**Solution Applied**:
- Completely redesigned `/demo/page.tsx` with 4 interactive demo categories
- Added demo environment setup with localStorage flags
- Created guided navigation to specific features (AI chat, document scanner, personalization, accessibility)
- Implemented loading states and feature descriptions for each demo

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS
- Interactive demo system with 4 working categories
- Demo environment properly configured
- Navigation to live features works correctly

**Solution Applied**:
- Simplified dynamic imports in `HomePage.tsx` 
- Disabled problematic 3D scene temporarily for stability
- Updated `next.config.mjs` with webpack configuration for better module resolution
- Cleared build cache and restarted development environment

**Test Result**: ✅ PASS
